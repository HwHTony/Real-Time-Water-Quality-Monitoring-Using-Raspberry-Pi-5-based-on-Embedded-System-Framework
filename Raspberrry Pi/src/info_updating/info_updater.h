 * @brief Information updater abstract base class, defining a unified interface for information updates

 *          Subclasses must implement this method according to their own functions (such as refreshing the TFT screen, printing debugging information, sending network data, etc.).
 *          Use interface design patterns to ensure consistency in the behaviour of different update modules within the system.
