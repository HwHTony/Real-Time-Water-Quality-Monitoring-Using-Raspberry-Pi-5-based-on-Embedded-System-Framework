# Qt Server Project

## Introduction
This is a Qt Server project, which is likely designed to build a server application using the Qt framework. Qt is a well - known cross - platform application development framework that offers a wide range of libraries and tools for building graphical user interfaces, network applications, and more. This server project might be used for various purposes such as handling network requests, data processing, and communication between different components.

## Prerequisites
- **CMake**: The project uses CMake to generate build files. You need to have CMake installed on your system. In the build process, CMake version 4.0 is used, and it can be found in the `/snap/cmake/1468` directory.
- **Qt**: The Qt framework is required for this project. The project depends on multiple Qt modules such as `QtCore`, `QtGui`, `QtNetwork`, and `QtWidgets`. You can find the related Qt configuration files in the `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/cmake/Qt5` directory.
- **GCC Compiler**: The project uses the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC). The build process references various GCC - related CMake modules.

## Compilation Steps
First, create a build directory (if it doesn't exist) and navigate to it. Then use CMake to generate the necessary build files.
```sh
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```
