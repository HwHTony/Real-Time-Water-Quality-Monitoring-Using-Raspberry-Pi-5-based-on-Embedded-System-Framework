# Water-Monitoring Project OverviewÂ 

Water Quality Monitoring System - Raspberry Pi Client Project Overview This project aims to use a Raspberry Pi 5B to connect water quality sensors (pH sensor, turbidity sensor, and temperature sensor), collect sensor data, and send the data in JSON format to a Qt server via Socket communication. The project is implemented in three phases:
Sensor Data Reading and Printing: Read sensor data and print it to the terminal.
Socket Communication: Send sensor data to the Qt server via TCP Socket.
JSON Data Packaging: Use the cJSON library to package sensor data into JSON format and send it.
